### The project moves into GitHub
- The v0.3 prototype is now the starting point of the real game, with its spec
  and design doc alongside it.
- Every change is now checked automatically: a bot plays the game in the cloud
  and any script error fails the check.
- Releases are automatic: one click (or a version tag) builds a Windows
  installer, a portable Windows zip, and Linux and macOS zips, and publishes
  them on the GitHub Releases page.
- The title screen now shows the game's version in the bottom-right corner.
- The game can now be exported for macOS as well as Windows and Linux. The old
  web build was removed: this is a desktop game.
- Every download now includes `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`, the licences for the
  Godot engine and the game's fonts.
- More automatic checks on every change: tests that the same seed always gives
  the same run, and a code style check.
